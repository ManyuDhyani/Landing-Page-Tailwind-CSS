## Apply Directive Concept

The image below shows the output for index.html utlizing some Apply Directive concept in tailwind css. <br />


This @apply directive is used for component which have to be used 
multiple time and that too with same style throughout the website, like button, etc.<br />

Note: Try to put the custom class before utility class in main.css as 
if we have to overwrite the custom class with utility class, we can do that easily. But if we want to override the utility classes then put custom style after @tailwind utilities; in main.css. Order for defining classes in css is important in tailwind.
